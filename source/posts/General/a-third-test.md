# Success!

I think I'm on a roll here, thanks to some great documentation online. This is my third post, and I'm going to attempt to publish using the fabric. It hasn't gone very well, so I am attempting another commit to see if it is working now. noooow, another edit to see if I can get Fab to get Pelican to fly.

## Another test
I updated the fab file to see if this will help allow me to publish properly.

## And another test.
derp.

# You're not done yet:

There's a few things on the list:

- Theme updates
	- The "Other Posts" section <strike>feels strange</strike> sucks a lot.
	- Not sure about the rounded cornders
	- Really not sure about the red and the tan

- Write some stuff
	- Post ideas:
		- *"The journey and the destination"* - I have a tendency to really enjoy the process of doing something more than the actual outcome. Examples would include all the trials of blogging platforms leading up to Pelican, the intense time spent on homebrew stuff for the Wii, etc. But jailbreaking the appleTV, though, has really enhanced the use of that device, and I hope this blogging platform will allow me to more easily get things online.

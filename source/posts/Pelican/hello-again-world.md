# I think we're set

I believe everything is properly in place to be generate the files and push to github to host the blog. 

There are a few things that I need to do now.

+	Patiently wait for the DNS to propagate to see if the domain is in fact working properly.
+	Do something about this theme. I have no idea where to begin with that.

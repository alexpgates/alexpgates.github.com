Good evening.

My name is Alex Gates. I live [in the Maplewood Neighborhood] with my wife Jamie, and our four children. My oldest daughter attends Wilson Focus School. My youngest daughter attends Edison Elementary.

I am the current president of the Edison Elementary PTA. Prior to leading the organization, I served two terms as Vice President. In total, I've been an active member of our PTA for 4 years.

**I'm here this evening to encourage OPS to create a documented process that allows parents, teachers, and staff to submit a formal request to investigate and remove ineffective school principals.**

--

I fully understand that any discussions related to the replacement of OPS staff comes with a host of challenges.

But please understand that the lack of a documented process creates a number of issues:

- Without a documented process, parents, teachers, and staff seek solutions but are left feeling ignored, hopeless, and frustrated. 

- When teachers are hopeless and frustrated, they simply quit. Schools lose great teachers.
 
- When parents are frustrated, they either pull their children out of OPS or they remain feeling angry and disenfranchised. They become cynical and unsupportive of their school and teachers. They vote against OPS ballot measures, and vote against incumbent OPS board representatives.

For years parents and teachers have been fighting for a new principal at Edison. 

At one point, a group of 4 highly respected teachers decided enough is enough and brought their struggles to the district to speak about the need for change at Edison. The following year, all four teachers were individually transferred to different schools in the district.<a class="footnote-link" href="#foot1">&#42;</a>

This retaliation and coercion has created an institution of fear within our school. Teachers are afraid to speak up because they don't want to be transferred, belittled at staff meetings, or bullied.

So instead, they're waiting it out. And year after year, despite the fact that our principal is beyond the retirement age and despite the fact that she's now in her sixteenth year as principal at Edison, nothing has changed.

Yes. Sixteen years. Sixteen years ago I was a sophomore in high school. Bill Clinton was being impeached. Two Stanford PhD candidates named Larry and Sergey founded a little company in California called Google. Sixteen years.

It's clear that as a district you understand the direct relationship between principal leadership and student performance. 

To quote Mr. Gareing, your consultant from Cross and Joftus: "It's all about Principal Leadership at the end of the day." and "The Principal role, when you get it right, makes everything work."

I know things are just getting started with the Executive Director positions, but I'm begging you to also bring members of active parent organizations to the table as well. Embrace them. Active parents are a wealth of information about the inner-working of a school. Active parents can be your best advocate for OPS issues and ballot measures. 

Mr Gareing also says "the Executive Directors will have information that nobody else has." Active parents don't have 20 other schools to observe. They usually have one, and they get to know it pretty well, over the course of many years. 

--

So how do I know there is no documented process? How do I know you're not embracing leaders of parent organizations?

In August I reached out to Mrs. Comine and asked two things. 

I asked for her advice on a the proper and respectful way for a parent group to request a new principal at our school. 

I also asked that teachers and staff be provided a safe way to speak up about school conditions without fear of retaliation.

**Mrs. Comine absolutely listened to my concerns, but she made that very clear that she couldn't provide advice on what we could do.**

--

Following our conversations, I drafted a thoughtful email to Superintendent Evans and asked the same questions. 

Mr. Evans made it very clear that they will "not discuss this type of issue." He did say we could compile "additional data" for Mrs. Comine, but when I asked what kind of data, I only received a short, condescending, sarcastic response.<a class="footnote-link" href="#foot2">&#42;&#42;</a>

That's it. That's the process. The doors were shut. There's been no follow-up, and there's been no assurance that anyone is even investigating issues.

And, despite asking three separate times how teachers and staff can speak up without fearing retaliation, I've only received radio silence.

I feel unvalued. I'm frustrated, and disenfranchised.

--

We have 89 members and counting in our PTA who are well aware of what's happening in our school. Many have spoken individually to the district to voice their concerns. They've all been brushed off. They're feeling frustrated, and disenfranchised, too.

I had one father (a former PTA member) tell me it's easier to remove a member of congress than it is to get a new principal, so he removed his children from OPS.

--

Mr. Wayne, Mrs. Goding, Mrs. Fey, Ms. Merica, Mr. Scanlan, Mr Snow, Mrs. Underwood, Mr. Vargas, and Mrs. Williams, please create a documented process to allow parents, teachers, and staff to submit a formal request to transparently investigate and remove ineffective school principals. 

Also, please encourage our Superintendent to value thoughtful emails from concerned parents, embrace feedback from active parents, and reply with solutions instead of sarcasm.

Surely your goal isn't to ignore, frustrate, and disenfranchise parents. But it's happening. 

I know you can create a policy, and if I can help, I'd be more than willing. I'll be available after the meeting if any of you would like to meet me and chat. Otherwise, please send an email to alexpgates@gmail.com. 

Thank you so much for your time this evening. I look forward to hearing from you.

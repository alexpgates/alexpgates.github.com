Title: Tacos! YUM!
Summary: This page is about tacos!
Slug: tacos/tacos-please

### Tacos

This page isn't _really_ about tacos. It's here because I need to remember how to structure my source files so I can have some non-blog pages if I ever decide to go that route.

My settings file is set to dump anything in the _/pages_ directory right to the root of the site, which I like. 

However, if you set the slog with a directory, it will work! <code>Slug: tacos/tacos-please</code>

I think we're good here. : )

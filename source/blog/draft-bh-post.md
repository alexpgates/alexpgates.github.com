At its core, Business Horizons is a week-long summer program designed for high school students who are interested business. In addition to an introduction to free enterprise, the business cycle, media rationales, investor presentations, and trade shows, students also spend the week learning more about themselves, working closely with new people, and experiencing life on a college campus. Speakers stress the importance of saving and spending money wisely, harnessing creativity, finding your passion, and looking at life through a different lens. Business simulations teach about production, inventory, capital investment, research and development, and marketing while guiding students through an accelerated business cycle so they can experience ups and downs of business and learn how to respond. All of this happens at the same time students are working closely with their team of about 12 students to prepare for an investor pitch, write / direct / edit an infomercial, and prepare for a trade show for a product that they created by duct taping taping together arbitrarily selected pieces of junk selected from a giant pile in the middle of a large room - about 2 hours after first meeting each other.

All of this happens in just five days. Students learn a lot about business, life, and time management. They begin the week as complete strangers, but part ways on the final day as best friends, stronger, more prepared for college, life, and business than they (or their parents) ever could have imagined.

##That was me, in 1998!
I had the opportunity to experience Business Horizons 15 years ago as a soon-to-be-junior in high school. My parents drove me from our home in Le Mars, IA to the campus of Drake University in Des Moines. I was the only student from my high school, which actually provided more of a sense of comfort than fear. I was able to be who I wanted to be for the week. I had a blank page. 

When it came time to introduce our duct-taped product to the entire group, I was the least terrified individual in the group and therefore chosen by default to speak in the microphone. I don't remember what I said, exactly, but I remember that it went _really well_. I was comfortable, confident, and I even had a few pretty great jokes. Those two-or-so minutes set the stage for a very positive, engaging week. My confidence swelled, and I was making friends with everyone.

##Fifteen years (!) later

At the end of July, I returned to Business Horizons for my _second_ consecutive year as an Industry Advisor. The role of an Industry Advisor is essentially to lead a small group of students through all the activities during the week. I had a co-advisor in 2012, but this year I had a group on my own. The students in my group were 16 - 18 years old, very bright, extremely motivated, incredibly generous, refreshingly polite, and inclusive. They were there to learn, but we ended up teaching each other.

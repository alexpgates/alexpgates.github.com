### A mouthpiece for hate groups

For the past six months, some individual or organization has been relentlessly vandalizing stop signs in front of Omaha grocery stores with messages that promote hate and intolerance in our community. (Sure, these folks aren't bright enough to understand the concept of double negatives, but that shouldn't give them a free pass to spread hate and vandalize property.)

The above photo (taken at <a href="http://www.hy-vee.com/" target="_blank">Hy-Vee</a> on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hy-Vee/@41.3077873,-96.0815128,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xcdc2424c807ee66e" target="_blank">108th and Fort in Omaha, NE</a>) is an example of the sticker that I've seen at two Hy-Vee locations in Omaha. These stickers are on the stop signs that sit **directly outside the main entrances**. They are **no more than ten feet from the door**.

### Yikes! Why don't you say something to the manager?

I have! **Seven times.**

On two separate occasions, I stopped by the customer service desk at the Hy-Vee on 108th and Fort and spoke with two different store managers about the stickers. In both instances the managers were very friendly, but they acted like they had _absolutely no idea_ that these stickers were right outside their doors. One assured me that he'd send someone out to remove the stickers, and the other followed me outside and removed the stickers himself.

I also had two separate conversations with store managers from the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Hy-Vee+Cass+Street&aq=&sll=41.250451,-95.978622&sspn=0.112928,0.141449&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=Hy-Vee+Cass+Street&t=m&z=17&iwloc=A&cid=4840955308226188896" target="_blank">79th and Cass location</a>. Like the store managers on Fort, these managers acted like they were _completely unaware_ that these stickers existed, **even though they're literally ten feet from every entrance to the store**. 

I also contacted Hy-Vee through their <a href="http://www.hy-vee.com/company/contact/" target="_blank">website</a> three times. In total, I've raised this issue with someone at Hy-Vee seven different times. *Seven*. All seven times I was assured that the issue would be addressed, and all seven times, it hasn't.

### What's the big deal, anyway?

Organizations behind messaging like this promote hatred and intolerance of anyone who *appears* to be an immigrant. They spread <a href="http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/f8/22/f822f3356f576dc6dcebefb2987571ea.jpg?itok=xodh5WbF" target="_blank">lies</a> and promote <a href="http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2955/75725997.jpg" target="_blank">fear</a>. They pretend that all immigrants are illegal thugs who are here to collect welfare and cause crime, even though <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/anecdotes-evidence-setting-record-straight-immigrants-and-crime-0" target="_blank">reality</a> says otherwise.

***Of course, these organizations, no matter how hateful and dishonest, are entitled to their own beliefs. But Hy-Vee needs to stop allowing their property to be used as a mouthpiece for hate groups in Omaha.*** 

### Okay, what should they do?

Store managers need to **pay attention** to the entrances of their stores. Employees who help carry groceries outside for customers should be instructed to **watch for and remove these stickers** from the stop signs. **Video footage should be examined**, and the people behind these stickers should be **arrested and charged with vandalism**. 

### What can we do?

Omahans should speak up. We need to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Please%2C%20%40hyvee%2C%20stop%20allowing%20your%20property%20to%20be%20used%20as%20a%20mouthpiece%20for%20hate%20in%20our%20community!%20http%3A%2F%2Falexpgates.com%2Fblog%2F2014%2F03%2Fhyvee-complicit-in-hate.html" target="_blank">ask Hy-Vee to stop allowing their property to be used as a mouthpiece for hate in our community</a>. If you notice a sticker, go to the customer service desk and ask to speak with the store manager. "We didn't notice it" isn't a good excuse. Let's *help* them notice it, and ask them to fix it.

Questions? Please feel free to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#108;&#101;&#120;&#64;&#119;&#104;&#97;&#116;&#99;&#104;&#101;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">email me</a>. I'd love to update this post with a response from Hy-Vee detailing how they'll *actually* put a plan in place to correct this issue. (hint hint)

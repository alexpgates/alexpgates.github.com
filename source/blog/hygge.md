I spent the second half of 1999 as an exchange student in Odense, Denmark. I was 17, and a senior in high school.

I could go on and on about how this experience shaped me in to who I am today, and how it taught me to view the world differently. But I won't. Not today, anyway.

Instead, I just want to share my favorite Danish word: _hygge_.

Hygge (Hue-gah) is difficult to translate to English. <a href="https://translate.google.com/#da/en/hygge">Google says</a> it means _fun_. <a href="http://translation.babylon.com/danish/to-english/">Others</a> get a bit closer with _enjoy_. I've also seen it translated as _coziness_, which may be just a hair closer. But all these definitions, even combined, fall short.

The truth is, most Danes would struggle with a clear definition of _hygge_ even without the extra step of translating it to English. That's because _hygge_ is a feeling, and feelings are very personal and usually hard to explain. 





You feel _hygge_ in your heart, and in your cheeks when you've been smiling a lot. You feel _hygge_ in your belly

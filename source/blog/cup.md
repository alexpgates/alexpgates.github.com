At my first job out of college, I learned something from one of the customer service reps that I’ve used so incredibly often. 

I was walking back from the break room with a very very full cup of coffee and struggling with it spilling.

She told me the secret to walking with a full cup of coffee: _don’t look at it_.

You know how to hold a mug of coffee and you know how to walk. So just do that.  When you look at it, you try to correct yourself, and you end up causing the spills.

It seems to me that this tiny piece of advice extends beyond coffee spill prevention. It’s a reminder to be confident in things we innately know how to do.

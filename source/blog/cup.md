While watching me wipe coffee off the office floor, Carla, one of my very first coworkers, shared a practical tip that I've used every day since.

> If you don't want to spill your coffee while walking, just don't look at the cup.

Makes sense, doesn't it? You know how to walk, and you know how to hold a cup of coffee. But if you _look_ at the cup while walking, your brain will panic a bit and over-correct your hand.

The next thing you know, the entire customer service department will be watching you wipe coffee off the floor with a napkin.
